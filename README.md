- The web application was developed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library, with the aim of implementing industry best practices. The application features Google Authentication using FIREBASE, with the entire database management system set up using the same technology. The admin functionality enables authorized personnel to upload new items to the menu.

- The application incorporates a cart functionality, allowing users to easily add and manage items they wish to purchase. Additionally, the items are filtered by category, providing a more streamlined user experience.

- The website boasts of a fully responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes and devices. The CSS and styling elements of the website were implemented using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that prioritizes high performance and customization.
